### MCP Global Summary

This file centralizes short-purpose summaries and usage instructions for active MCP servers referenced in the repository. Each MCP entry should include: purpose, when to use it, quick-start sequence using MCP tools (no shell commands), and links to any detailed rule files under `.cursor/rules/`.

## Playwright MCP (summary)

**Purpose:** Run deterministic browser automation via RPC calls for navigation, DOM interactions, network assertions, and artifact capture without invoking shell commands.

**When to use:** When you need automated browser flows from higher-level controllers, reproducible codegen/recording, or to capture page artifacts and logs in CI/automation contexts.

**Quick sequence:**
- Start codegen session: `mcp_playwright_start_codegen_session`
- Navigate & interact: `mcp_playwright_playwright_navigate`, `mcp_playwright_playwright_click`, `mcp_playwright_playwright_fill`, ...
- Capture artifacts: `mcp_playwright_playwright_screenshot`, `mcp_playwright_playwright_get_visible_html`
- End codegen / close: `mcp_playwright_playwright_end_codegen_session`, `mcp_playwright_playwright_close`

**Reference rule:** `.cursor/rules/mcp-playwright-navigation.mdc`

If you add new MCP servers, append a short summary here and create a detailed rule under `.cursor/rules/`.
