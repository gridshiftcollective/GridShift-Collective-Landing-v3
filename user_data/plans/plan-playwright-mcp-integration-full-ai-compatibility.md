# Implementation Blueprint (SPARC): Playwright MCP Integration with Full AI Compatibility

## 0. Executive Overview (Context Pack)
- **Objective**: Create a comprehensive rule file for Playwright MCP integration that enables full AI compatibility, allowing Cursor AI agents to perform automated web testing, browser interactions, and test generation from natural language descriptions.
- **High-Level Overview**: Implement complete Playwright MCP integration with standardized configurations, AI-optimized workflows, and detailed instructions for AI agents to interact with web applications, generate tests, and execute browser automation tasks within the GridShift project.
- **Divergence Synthesis**: Adopted the comprehensive MCP integration approach (Option B) over basic manual setup. This provides AI-augmented testing capabilities with standardized viewports and semantic locators. Resolved conflicts by prioritizing AI compatibility while maintaining project-specific configurations and existing Vite/React/TypeScript stack integration.
- **Business Impact & Success Metrics**: Enables 10x faster test creation through AI generation, ensures consistent cross-device testing, reduces manual testing time by 80%, achieves 95% test reliability across viewports.
- **Constraints & Assumptions**: Must integrate with existing Cursor AI environment, Playwright browsers installed, project-specific MCP configuration preferred over global.

## S — Specification

### Problem Statement and Current-State Summary
Playwright is installed but not configured for AI-assisted testing. No MCP integration exists, viewports are not standardized, and AI agents lack clear instructions for web automation tasks. Current basic test exists but lacks AI-driven generation capabilities.

### Functional Requirements
1. AI agents can generate Playwright tests from natural language descriptions
2. Standardized mobile/tablet/desktop viewports configured for consistent testing
3. MCP server properly configured for project-specific Cursor AI integration
4. Semantic locators and auto-waiting capabilities leveraged by AI agents
5. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) through single API
6. Screenshot, HTML extraction, and JavaScript execution capabilities for AI agents
7. Test execution and reporting integration with existing workflow

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Test execution under 30 seconds per test case
- **Reliability**: 95% success rate for AI-generated tests on first execution
- **Security**: No sensitive data exposure in test configurations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of AI instructions and technical configurations
- **Usability**: Natural language test generation with minimal AI prompting

### Scope (In / Out)
- **In**: Playwright MCP integration, AI instruction development, viewport configuration, rule file creation
- **Out**: Production deployment changes, third-party AI model training, hardware procurement

### Stakeholders & User Scenarios
- **AI Agents**: Need clear instructions for web automation tasks
- **Developers**: Want AI-assisted test generation and execution
- **QA Engineers**: Require consistent cross-device testing capabilities

### Dependencies
- Playwright browsers installed (`npx playwright install`)
- Cursor AI with MCP support enabled
- Node.js environment with npm/yarn
- Existing Vite development server for local testing

### Acceptance Criteria
1. MCP server connects successfully in Cursor AI
2. AI agents can generate and execute basic navigation tests
3. All three viewport configurations (mobile/tablet/desktop) work correctly
4. Rule file provides clear guidance for 10+ common web automation scenarios
5. Generated tests pass on at least 2 different browsers

## P — Pseudocode (End-to-End and Module-Level)

### System-level flow pseudocode (from entry to persistence and response)
```
1. User/AI describes test scenario: "Test GridShift homepage loads correctly on mobile"
2. AI agent parses description and identifies:
   - Target URL: https://gridshift.vercel.app
   - Actions: navigate, verify content
   - Viewport: mobile (390x844)
   - Assertions: page loads, content visible
3. AI agent generates Playwright test code:
   - Import statements and test structure
   - Page navigation with specified viewport
   - Semantic locators for content verification
   - Assertions for success criteria
4. Execute test via Playwright MCP server
5. Return results: pass/fail status, screenshots, error logs
6. AI agent iterates based on results if needed
```

### Module-level pseudocode (each service/component)
```
class PlaywrightMCPRuleEngine:
    def __init__(self, project_config):
        self.config = project_config
        self.viewports = {
            'mobile': {'width': 390, 'height': 844},
            'tablet': {'width': 834, 'height': 1194},
            'desktop': {'width': 1920, 'height': 1080}
        }

    def parse_test_request(description: str) -> TestSpec:
        # Extract intent, actions, assertions from natural language
        # Map to Playwright actions and locators
        # Return structured test specification

    def generate_test_code(spec: TestSpec) -> str:
        # Create TypeScript test file content
        # Include proper imports and test structure
        # Add semantic locators and assertions
        # Return complete test code

    def configure_viewport(device: str) -> dict:
        # Return viewport configuration for specified device
        # Handle custom viewport requests

    def execute_test(test_code: str, browser: str) -> TestResult:
        # Send test to Playwright MCP server
        # Execute in specified browser
        # Return results with screenshots/logs
```

### Data flow & state transitions
```
Natural Language Input → Intent Parsing → Test Specification → Code Generation → MCP Execution → Results Analysis → Iteration/Completion
```

### Interface contracts (function signatures, types, schemas)
```typescript
interface TestSpec {
  description: string;
  url: string;
  actions: Action[];
  assertions: Assertion[];
  viewport: Viewport;
  browser: Browser;
}

interface Action {
  type: 'navigate' | 'click' | 'fill' | 'hover' | 'scroll';
  selector: string;
  value?: string;
}

interface Assertion {
  type: 'visible' | 'text' | 'count' | 'url';
  selector?: string;
  expected: any;
}

type Viewport = 'mobile' | 'tablet' | 'desktop' | {width: number, height: number};
type Browser = 'chromium' | 'firefox' | 'webkit' | 'all';
```

## A — Architecture

### Component/Module Boundaries and Responsibilities
- **MCP Configuration Layer**: `.cursor/mcp.json` - manages Cursor AI integration
- **Playwright Configuration Layer**: `playwright.config.js` - defines test environments and viewports
- **Rule Engine**: `.cursor/rules/playwright-mcp-integration.md` - AI behavior guidelines and instructions
- **Test Generation Module**: AI agent logic for converting natural language to Playwright code
- **Execution Module**: Playwright MCP server handling test execution and results
- **Reporting Module**: HTML reports and result analysis

### Data Model & Schema Changes
No database changes required. Test results stored as JSON artifacts:
```json
{
  "testId": "string",
  "status": "passed|failed",
  "duration": "number",
  "browser": "string",
  "viewport": "object",
  "screenshots": ["string"],
  "errors": ["string"],
  "assertions": ["object"]
}
```

### API Contracts
- **MCP Server Interface**: Standard Model Context Protocol for tool execution
- **Test Generation API**: Natural language → Playwright code conversion
- **Browser Automation API**: Page interactions, element queries, assertions

### Deployment & Environment
- **Development**: Local Vite server integration
- **Testing**: Playwright test runner with configured projects
- **CI/CD**: Parallel test execution across viewports and browsers

### Observability (logs, metrics, traces), SLOs/SLIs
- **Logs**: Test execution logs, AI generation traces, MCP server logs
- **Metrics**: Test success rate, generation time, execution time per viewport
- **SLOs**: 95% test reliability, <30s execution time, 100% MCP connectivity

### Security & Compliance
- No sensitive data in test configurations
- Isolated browser contexts for each test
- Clean session handling to prevent data leakage

### Performance Considerations
- Parallel test execution across viewports
- Browser context reuse where possible
- Optimized locator strategies (semantic over CSS/XPath)

### Migration & Backward Compatibility Strategy
- Existing basic test preserved and enhanced
- Gradual rollout of AI capabilities
- Backward compatibility maintained for manual test writing

## R — Refinement

### Alternative Approaches & Trade-offs
- **Global MCP vs Project-specific**: Chose project-specific for isolation and consistency
- **Multiple AI models vs Single approach**: Focused on Cursor AI integration for unified workflow
- **Comprehensive rules vs Minimal instructions**: Chose comprehensive approach for better AI reliability

### Risks & Mitigations
- **MCP Server Instability**: Implement retry logic and fallback to manual execution
- **AI Generation Inconsistency**: Provide detailed examples and validation steps
- **Browser Compatibility Issues**: Test across all supported browsers during setup
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor execution times and optimize configurations

### Failure Modes & Rollback Plan
- **MCP Connection Failure**: Fallback to manual Playwright commands
- **Test Generation Errors**: Provide manual test templates as backup
- **Browser Execution Issues**: Isolate to specific browser, continue with others

### Edge Cases & Error Handling Strategy
- Dynamic content loading: Use explicit waits and retry mechanisms
- Network timeouts: Configure appropriate timeout values
- Element not found: Fallback to alternative locator strategies
- Browser crashes: Automatic restart and re-execution

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Rule parsing and code generation logic
- **Integration Tests**: MCP server connectivity and basic interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Full test generation and execution workflows
- **Cross-browser Tests**: All supported browsers with different viewports
- **Performance Tests**: Execution time validation across scenarios
